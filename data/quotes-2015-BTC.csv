First, Bitcoin at its most fundamental level is a breakthrough in computer science -- one that builds on 20 years of research into cryptographic currency, and 40 years of research in cryptography, by thousands of researchers around the world. The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer.

I think you can probably blame this archaic support for weak keys on the U.S. cryptography export laws, which are hopefully well enough in our rear view mirror by now to move on. What really concerns me about LogJam and vulnerabilities giving hackers access to encrypted web traffic is that it further exposes browsers to `watering hole' attacks. Imagine if attackers gain credentials and access to content authoring suites at popular websites, and use this access to maliciously customize trusted content to spread malware via drive-by without any need for phishing. It's great that browsers are getting patched to address this, but now the burden rests with users and IT professionals to distribute the patches. I think the task of updating billions of browsers on all platforms, including those browsers nested within mobile apps and IoT devices, might be daunting and take a long time.

Raquel Benedicto often wears a black Clockwork Orange hoodie and has dyed-red hair. There are rings all over her ears. Her nose is pierced at the bridge and septum, though the piercings are not always in use anymore. She has to avoid street protests, because when cops attack her she fights back, and she can't risk that now that she's a mother. While the idea for Bitcoin is to consign transactions entirely to software, bypassing the perceived risk of trusting central authorities and flawed human beings, the CIC's currency depends on a community of people who trust one another fully. With her brother, recently returned from years of food service and surfing in the British Isles, she started the town's only restaurant, Restaurant Terra, at the end of 2014. It is a CIC project through and through: Meals can be paid for in ecos, and it regularly plays host to regional assemblies. Members of the local forestry cooperative, which uses a donkey to help carry away logs, come to her for their pay. In the back, Benedicto is also starting a school for local kids, including her three-year-old son, Roc. Benedicto met Duran during the 15M movement's occupation in 2011.

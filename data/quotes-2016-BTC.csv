2016-07-01-099671,"The Ethereum community should be more cognizant of the long term dangers of censorship and intervention at the protocol level. The meta description for their site says: `Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference.' The hard fork proposal, while well-intentioned, would interfere with the protocol to retrieve the DAO funds. This opens up a Pandora's box of other questions about why funds should be recovered in certain cases and not others, and what would happen when governments come knocking. If they go through with it, they should make it very clear that this is a one-time only fix. A similar situation is less likely for the Bitcoin community, because we structured our protocol differently. At the core of the values of Bitcoin is to keep complex functionality out of the low level protocol, as complexity is the enemy of security. That said, if there were an issue with an application on a Layer 2 protocol, there's no chance the Bitcoin community would support a fork that would take currency out of circulation, or modify ownership of the currency. Even considering such a move would be preposterous to many, as it's in such opposition to the community values.

2016-08-08-019031,"Following the theft on August 2nd, the Bitfinex team has been working tirelessly towards bringing the platform back online in a secure and controlled manner. We have finalized the accounting of losses incurred and are currently coordinating strategic plans for compensating customers. We intend to come online within 24-48 hours with limited platform functionality. Additional announcements will be made as we progressively enable more platform features and return to full operations. We appreciate that our customers and the public want this handled quickly, but it needs to be done a way in which all assets are secure and immune from vulnerabilities. Every resource is being leveraged to make that happen in a safe and optimal way. As disclosed in earlier announcements, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers have been canceled and all financed positions have been settled. Exact settlement prices were published on August 3rd. After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses. We are actively discussing various strategic options with numerous potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. Such discussions, however, are in early stages and will likely take time to play out. In the meantime, In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customer's discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged -- upon the creditor's request and Bitfinex's acceptance -- for shares of iFinex Inc.. We are still sorting out many details on this; we will post further updates in the coming days. Thank you for your continued patience and for the many generous offers of support that we have received over the last several days.

2016-08-08-019032,"Following the theft on August 2nd, the Bitfinex team has been working tirelessly towards bringing the platform back online in a secure and controlled manner. We have finalized the accounting of losses incurred and are currently coordinating strategic plans for compensating customers. We intend to come online within 24-48 hours with limited platform functionality. Additional announcements will be made as we progressively enable more platform features and return to full operations. We appreciate that our customers and the public want this handled quickly, but it needs to be done a way in which all assets are secure and immune from vulnerabilities. Every resource is being leveraged to make that happen in a safe and optimal way. As disclosed in earlier announcements, all withdrawals, open orders, and open funding offers have been canceled and all financed positions have been settled. Exact settlement prices were published on August 3rd. After much thought, analysis, and consultation, we have arrived at the conclusion that losses must be generalized across all accounts and assets. This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context. Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067%. In a later announcement we will explain in full detail the methodology used to compute these losses. We are actively discussing various strategic options with numerous potential investors as part of our strategy to fully compensate our customers. Such discussions, however, are in early stages and will likely take time to play out. In the meantime, In place of the loss in each wallet, we are crediting a token labeled BFX to record each customer's discrete losses. Tokens will be distributed without release or waiver. The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged-upon the creditor's request and Bitfinex's acceptance-for shares of iFinex Inc.. We are still sorting out many details on this; we will post further updates in the coming days.

2016-08-06-027258,"In 1996, Congress amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to emphasize sound science and risk-based standard setting, small water supply system flexibility and technical assistance, community-empowered source water assessment and protection, public right-to-know, and water system infrastructure assistance through a multi-billion-dollar state revolving loan fund. The amendments were signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 6, 1996. Main points of the 1996 amendments Consumer Confidence Reports: All community water systems must prepare and distribute annual reports about the water they provide, including information on detected contaminants, possible health effects, and the water's source. Cost-Benefit Analysis: EPA must conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis for every new standard to determine whether the benefits of a drinking water standard justify the costs. Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. [ 24 ] States can use this fund to help water systems make infrastructure or management improvements or to help systems assess and protect their source water. Microbial Contaminants and Disinfection Byproducts: EPA is required to strengthen protection for microbial contaminants, including cryptosporidium, while strengthening control over the byproducts of chemical disinfection. EPA promulgated the Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule [ 25 ] and the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule [ 26 ] to address these risks. Operator Certification: Water system operators must be certified to ensure that systems are operated safely. EPA issued guidelines in 1999 specifying minimum standards for the certification and recertification of the operators of community and non-transient, noncommunity water systems. [ 27 ] These guidelines apply to state operator certification programs. All states are currently implementing EPA-approved operator certification programs. Public Information and Consultation: SDWA emphasizes that consumers have a right to know what is in their drinking water, where it comes from, how it is treated, and how to help protect it. EPA distributes public information materials (through its Drinking Water Hotline, Safewater web site, and Resource Center) and holds public meetings, working with states, tribes, water systems, and environmental and civic groups, to encourage public involvement. Small Water Systems: Small water systems are given special consideration and resources under SDWA, to make sure they have the managerial, financial, and technical ability to comply with drinking water standards.",None,[],2016-08-06 13:18:50,3,"[['None', '0.5764'], ['President Clinton', '0.4236']]","['http://thisdayinwaterhistory.wordpress.com/2016/08/06/august-6-1996-amendments-to-safe-drinking-water-act-3/', 'http://thisdayinwaterhistory.wordpress.com/2017/08/06/august-6-1996-amendments-to-safe-drinking-water-act-4/', 'http://thisdayinwaterhistory.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/august-6-2018-denver-water-turns-100-1996-amendments-to-safe-drinking-water-act/']",E

I still believe the priorities for Bitcoin should be security, reliability, and then everything else and I am helping with the Bitcoin Classic project for two reasons: First, because I believe Bitcoin Core is failing to keep Bitcoin reliable. As we run into the one megabyte block size limit transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable. Since the whole purpose of Bitcoin is to reliably, securely process transactions I believe that is a major mis-step. And second, because I believe that innovation and excellence is driven by competition and choice. I plan on contributing to multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol because I would like to see more diversity of implementations. A diverse network is, in the long run, more reliable and secure -- a bug or problem in one particular implementation will not destroy the entire network. I think the current debate about the block size limit reflects a difference in priorities -- from what they have written, I believe the most active Bitcoin Core contributors value increased decentralization above reliability. I think that is a mistake. I think decentralization is a means to achieving security against censorship and denial-of-service threats (whether traditional denial of service attacks or governments trying to shut down the network by passing laws and seizing servers), and I strongly believe that increasing the block size limit will have large reliability benefits with an almost zero impact on security.",Gavin Andresen,['Q16972222'],2016-02-18 08:21:36,1,"[['Gavin Andresen', '0.8475'], ['None', '0.1525']]",['http://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-classic-has-turned-the-world-upside-down'],E
